```

The size of *instacart* dataset is 1384617, 15 and the structure of
column types are tbl\_df, tbl, data.frame and stucture also contains t
variable names which are order\_id, product\_id, add\_to\_cart\_order,
reordered, user\_id, eval\_set, order\_number, order\_dow,
order\_hour\_of\_day, days\_since\_prior\_order, product\_name,
aisle\_id, department\_id, aisle, department. The key variables in this
questions are *aisle* showing different passages conveying different
types of products, *product\_name* showing the product types bought by
people, *order\_hour\_of\_day* showing the time of the order,
*order\_dow* showing the day of the week. *reordered* is a binary
variable to describle whether this product is reordered by this
customer. *aisle\_id* is a code of each aisle. Both variablesâ€™
observations give comprehensive information and convenience to make
people do analysis.
